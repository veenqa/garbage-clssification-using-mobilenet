Garbage Classification Using Transfer Learning -  MobileNetV2

This project implements an image classification system to automatically classify garbage into six categories using transfer learning with MobileNetV2. It uses TensorFlow and Keras to train a lightweight, accurate, and efficient model suitable for deployment in real-world waste management systems.

Features
  1.Pretrained MobileNetV2 as the feature extractor

  2. Mixed precision training for speed and efficiency

  3. Class weight balancing for imbalanced datasets

  4.  Data augmentation - flip, rotate, zoom

  5. Exponential learning rate decay

  6. Optional fine-tuning of base model

  7. Accuracy/loss visualization and export

  8. Final model saved in .h5 format
